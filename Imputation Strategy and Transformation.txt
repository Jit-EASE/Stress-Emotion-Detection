Imputation, Transformation, and Cleaning Strategy
This methodology outlines the end-to-end process for creating and refining the Baseline (2019), Enhanced (2022), and RealWorld datasets, followed by a cleaning stage to address severe multicollinearity issues detected during regression diagnostics.

1. Dataset Construction — Baseline, Enhanced, RealWorld
The initial versions of the datasets were built from integrated public, private, and academic data sources to align with recognised economic and mental health (MH) benchmarks.

1.1 Source Integration
Public Datasets

BEEPS (2020, World Bank/EBRD): Managerial demographics (age, education), MH responsibility indicators (EUb6a/b7a).

CSO Structural Business Statistics (SBS): Firm productivity (sales per employee), demographics, NACE codes.

CSO Labour Force Survey (LFS): Absenteeism and workforce size by sector/region.

Enterprise Ireland Firm Registry: Firm classification by size and sector.

Private Corporate MH Datasets

Laya Healthcare Pulse Report (2024): Absenteeism, anxiety prevalence, MH programme uptake.

SilverCloud (2023): Digital MH adoption rates, engagement outcomes.

Irish Life Health Reports: HR policy trends, MH budget benchmarks.

Academic & Benchmark Validation Sources

UCC CUBS Healthy Workplace Report (2023): Board-level MH leadership, stigma indices.

Peer-reviewed ROI benchmarks (Chisholm et al., 2016; Hawrilenko et al., 2025; IJERPH, BMC Public Health, The Lancet Psychiatry).

2. Harmonisation and Data Transformations
Standardisation of Units: Converted turnover/productivity to constant 2022 euros (CSO deflators, OECD, 2021).

Annualisation: Absenteeism expressed as annualised days lost per employee.

Likert to Binary: Survey scores (1–5) recoded to binary “strong agreement” flags (≥4) (Garman et al., 2022).

Sectoral Recoding: NACE codes aggregated into five broad categories (ICT/Finance, Healthcare/Education, Retail/Hospitality, Manufacturing, Construction/Logistics).

Log Transformations: Applied to skewed financial variables to reduce heteroskedasticity.

AI Metrics Standardisation: AI-derived emotion/stress detection scores z-standardised across firm sizes.

3. Imputation Logic
Median Sectoral Imputation: Continuous gaps (absenteeism_days, turnover_rate) filled using sector-size medians (Bryson et al., 2020).

Hot Deck Imputation: Categorical gaps (leadership_support) filled via donor matching on firm size & sector (Andridge & Little, 2010).

Regression-Based Imputation: Manager age predicted using education, firm size, and region as predictors.

Validation:

Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for distributional alignment.

Sensitivity checks re-running models on complete cases.

Outlier diagnostics via Cook’s Distance ±3 SD rule.

Metadata consistency checks between absenteeism per employee and CSO aggregates.

4. The Multicollinearity Problem in Initial Datasets
After the Baseline, Enhanced, and RealWorld datasets were fully integrated,
regression diagnostics revealed severe multicollinearity in the RealWorld dataset used for DiD modelling.

The core issue:

The dataset included treat, post, and treat_post simultaneously.

Since treat_post = treat × post, it is mathematically dependent on the other two, producing perfect or near-perfect collinearity.

Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for at least one term spiked to extreme levels, signalling unstable coefficient estimates.

Risk of singular matrix errors or variable auto-drop in some econometric software.

5. Cleaning Stage — Regenerating the Datasets
To eliminate collinearity while preserving analytical integrity:

treat_post removed from the stored Cleaned RealWorld dataset (can be programmatically recomputed during modelling if needed).

All other transformations, imputations, and recodings were preserved exactly as in the original build.

Post-cleaning VIF check:

Original RealWorld: VIFs inflated due to treat_post.

Cleaned RealWorld: treat and post both had VIF = 1.0, confirming no collinearity.

Baseline and Enhanced datasets were also regenerated in parallel to maintain alignment with the cleaned schema.

6. Simulation Assumptions (Optional AI Variables)
For scenarios with AI-enhanced workplace MH interventions:

Deployment Rates: 15% (ICT/Finance), 5% (Manufacturing/Logistics) (SilverCloud, 2023; EC, 2022).

Effect Size Calibration: 10–20% well-being improvement (Hawrilenko et al., 2025).

GDPR/EU AI Act Compliance: Aggregated firm-level only, non-identifiable data.

Counterfactual Integration: DiD run with & without AI variables to isolate effect.

7. Reproducibility and Transparency
All integration, transformation, and imputation scripts written in Python/Pandas, imputation in scikit-learn, diagnostics in statsmodels.

Version control maintained in a public GitHub repository for open-science compliance.

Cleaned datasets (Baseline_Policy_Clean.csv, Enhanced_Policy_Clean.csv, RealWorld_DiD_Clean.csv) stored alongside variable-level metadata documenting source and method for every field.
